# YALDebtClockHelper
Allows YAL activists to easily see the US National Debt for Visualize the Debt events.

View the current US National Debt at a particular moment, and update it upon request. This makes it easier for YAL activists to show Visualize the Debt participants how fast the US National Debt is increasing.

Contributions from other YAL members with programming skills are welcome!
